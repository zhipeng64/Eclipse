# Eclipse Project

## Overview

Eclipse is a full-stack real-time communication application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). The application features a robust **RESTful API** architecture combined with **Socket.IO** for real-time communication capabilities.

## Architecture

The project follows a **layered architecture** pattern that separates concerns and promotes maintainability:

- **Presentation Layer**: React frontend with component-based architecture
- **API Layer**: Express.js RESTful endpoints for HTTP communication
- **Service Layer**: Business logic and application services
- **Data Access Layer**: MongoDB database operations and repositories
- **Real-time Layer**: Socket.IO for live communication features

## Current Version: v1

### Features

âœ… **User Authentication & Authorization**

- Secure user registration and login
- JWT-based authentication
- Session management with refresh tokens
- Protected routes and middleware

âœ… **Real-time Communication**

- Socket.IO integration for live messaging
- Friend system (add/accept friend requests)
- Real-time chat functionality
- Online status tracking

âœ… **Friend Management**

- Send and receive friend requests
- Accept/decline friend invitations
- Friends list management
- Real-time friend status updates

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
